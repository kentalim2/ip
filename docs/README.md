## FAQ

**Q: How do I transfer my data to another computer?**  
A: Copy the `tasks.txt` file along with the JAR file to the new computer.

**Q: What happens if I accidentally close the application without typing `bye`?**  
A: Your recent changes might not be saved. Always use the `bye` command to ensure your data is saved properly.

**Q: Can I edit tasks directly in the text file?**  
A: It's not recommended as it might corrupt the data format. Use the application commands instead.
